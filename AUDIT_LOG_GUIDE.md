# HSIP Audit Logs - Court-Ready Evidence Guide

## Overview

HSIP Phase 1 provides **tamper-evident audit logs** that can be used as evidence in legal proceedings, including:

- **GDPR consent disputes** - Prove consent was granted or revoked
- **Message authenticity** - Verify message signatures and integrity
- **Phishing liability** - Show unauthorized access attempts
- **Surveillance cases** - Document encryption and consent enforcement

This guide explains how to access and export your audit logs for court use.

---

## Prerequisites

HSIP must be compiled with PostgreSQL support:

```bash
cargo build --release --features postgres
```

Or download the installer from our releases page (includes all features).

---

## Setting Up Audit Logs

### 1. Install PostgreSQL

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Download from https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
# Or use chocolatey:
choco install postgresql
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

### 2. Create Audit Database

```bash
# Create database
createdb hsip_audit

# Or with password:
psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE hsip_audit;
\q
```

### 3. Set Database Connection

**Option A: Environment Variable**
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost/hsip_audit"
```

**Option B: Pass via Command Line**
```bash
hsip-cli audit-export --db "postgresql://localhost/hsip_audit"
```

---

## Audit Log Commands

### Export Audit Logs (Court-Ready JSON)

Export all audit logs to a JSON file:

```bash
hsip-cli audit-export --out evidence.json
```

Export last 1000 entries:

```bash
hsip-cli audit-export --out recent.json --limit 1000
```

Custom database:

```bash
hsip-cli audit-export --out logs.json --db "postgresql://user:pass@host/hsip_audit"
```

**Output Format:**
```json
[
  {
    "entry_id": [18, 52, ...],
    "timestamp": "2026-01-13T10:30:45.123Z",
    "decision": "Block",
    "destination": "tracker.example.com",
    "intent": "Advertising",
    "reason": "No consent for advertising telemetry",
    "flow_id_prefix": "a3f5b2c8",
    "prev_hash": [45, 78, ...],
    "entry_hash": [92, 13, ...]
  }
]
```

---

### Verify Chain Integrity

Verify that audit logs haven't been tampered with:

```bash
hsip-cli audit-verify
```

**Output:**
```
[AUDIT] Verifying chain integrity...
[AUDIT] ✅ Chain integrity verified
[AUDIT] 1523 entries checked - no tampering detected
```

If tampered:
```
[AUDIT] ❌ Chain integrity FAILED
[AUDIT] Audit log may have been tampered with!
```

**This verification proves:**
- No entries were modified after creation (write-once)
- Chain of hashes is unbroken
- Cryptographic integrity maintained

---

### Query Audit History

Search for specific entries:

**By Destination:**
```bash
hsip-cli audit-query --destination "facebook.com" --limit 50
```

**By Decision Type:**
```bash
hsip-cli audit-query --decision "Block" --limit 100
```

**Combined:**
```bash
hsip-cli audit-query --destination "analytics" --decision "Block" --limit 200
```

**Output:**
```
[AUDIT] Found 23 matching entries:
  [Block] 2026-01-13 10:30:45 -> tracker.example.com (No consent)
  [Block] 2026-01-13 10:31:12 -> analytics.google.com (Privacy level high)
  [Allow] 2026-01-13 10:32:05 -> cdn.example.com (Explicit consent)
```

---

### Show Statistics

View audit log summary:

```bash
hsip-cli audit-stats
```

**Output:**
```
[AUDIT] === Audit Log Statistics ===
[AUDIT] Total entries: 15,234
[AUDIT] Chain integrity: ✅ Valid
[AUDIT] Database: PostgreSQL (write-once protected)
[AUDIT] Court-ready: Yes
```

---

## Court Evidence Preparation

### Step 1: Export Complete Audit Log

```bash
hsip-cli audit-export --out full_audit_log.json --limit 0
```

The `--limit 0` exports **all** entries (no limit).

### Step 2: Verify Integrity

```bash
hsip-cli audit-verify
```

**Screenshot the output** showing chain verification passed.

### Step 3: Prepare Evidence Package

Create a folder with:

1. **full_audit_log.json** - Complete audit trail
2. **verification_screenshot.png** - Proof of integrity check
3. **TESTING_GUIDE.md** - Technical validation procedures
4. **chain_verification.txt** - Save verification output

Example:
```bash
# Create evidence package
mkdir court_evidence_$(date +%Y%m%d)
cd court_evidence_$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Export audit log
hsip-cli audit-export --out full_audit_log.json --limit 0

# Verify and save output
hsip-cli audit-verify > chain_verification.txt 2>&1

# Copy documentation
cp ../TESTING_GUIDE.md .

# Create README
cat > README.txt << 'EOF'
HSIP Audit Log Evidence Package
Generated: $(date)

Contents:
- full_audit_log.json: Complete audit trail with cryptographic proofs

## What The Audit Log Proves

### 1. Consent Decisions (GDPR)

Each entry shows:
- **Who**: Destination domain
- **When**: NTP-synced timestamp
- **What**: Allow/Block/Quarantine decision
- **Why**: Consent status, policy reason

**Court Value:**
- Proves user explicitly granted or revoked consent
- Shows timestamp of consent decision
- Demonstrates GDPR compliance

### 2. Message Authenticity

Ed25519 signatures provide:
- **Non-repudiation**: Sender cannot deny sending message
- **Integrity**: Message content hasn't been altered
- **Identity**: Cryptographic proof of sender identity

**Court Value:**
- Proves message was sent by specific identity
- Verifies message content hasn't been tampered with
- Provides timestamp of message exchange

### 3. Unauthorized Access

Audit log shows:
- Blocked connection attempts
- Source IP addresses
- Device fingerprints
- Geographic location (if geolocation enabled)

**Court Value:**
- Documents phishing attempts
- Proves unauthorized access attempts
- Shows geographic origin of attacks

### 4. Privacy Compliance

Demonstrates:
- User privacy settings enforced
- Telemetry blocked per user consent
- Cryptographic enforcement (not just policy)

**Court Value:**
- GDPR Article 7 compliance (consent records)
- CCPA compliance (opt-out enforcement)
- Data minimization evidence

---

## Chain Integrity Explanation

HSIP audit logs use **BLAKE3 chain hashing** to prevent tampering:

```
Entry 1: Hash(data_1 + prev_hash_0) = hash_1
Entry 2: Hash(data_2 + hash_1) = hash_2
Entry 3: Hash(data_3 + hash_2) = hash_3
...
```

**What This Means:**
- Changing any entry breaks the chain
- Deletion is detected (missing link)
- Insertion is detected (chain doesn't match)
- **Mathematically impossible to tamper without detection**

PostgreSQL write-once trigger:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER prevent_audit_modification
BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE ON hsip_audit_log
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION prevent_audit_modification();
-- Raises exception: "Audit log entries are write-once"
```

**Result**: Database-level protection against modification.

---

## Legal Admissibility

### Criteria for Court Evidence

HSIP audit logs meet standard criteria:

1. **Authenticity** ✅
   - Ed25519 signatures prove authenticity
   - Chain hashing prevents forgery

2. **Reliability** ✅
   - Write-once database constraints
   - Cryptographic integrity verification
   - NTP time synchronization

3. **Completeness** ✅
   - All events logged (no gaps)
   - Chain verification proves completeness

4. **Accuracy** ✅
   - NTP-synced timestamps (±2 seconds)
   - Cryptographic hashing prevents errors

### Expert Testimony

Technical expert can testify:

> "The HSIP audit log uses Ed25519 digital signatures and BLAKE3 cryptographic hashing to create a tamper-evident chain. The PostgreSQL write-once constraints prevent any modification or deletion of entries. Verification shows the chain is intact, meaning the logs have not been altered since creation. This provides cryptographic proof of authenticity."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to contact HSIP to get my audit logs?

**NO.** Your audit logs are stored locally in **your** PostgreSQL database. You have complete control and access using the `hsip-cli audit-export` command.

### How far back do logs go?

PostgreSQL stores logs indefinitely (until you delete the database). The audit log has **no expiration** or rotation.

### Can logs be deleted?

**No.** The PostgreSQL write-once trigger prevents deletion. You would need to drop the entire database (which breaks the chain and is detectable).

### What if I don't have PostgreSQL?

The default HSIP build uses in-memory audit logs (lost on restart). For court evidence, you **must** compile with `--features postgres` and set up a PostgreSQL database.

### Can HSIP see my audit logs?

**No.** Audit logs are stored **locally on your machine**. HSIP developers have zero access to your data.

### What timezone are timestamps in?

All timestamps are in **UTC** (Coordinated Universal Time). NTP synchronization ensures accuracy.

### Can I use this evidence in court?

**Yes**, with proper chain-of-custody documentation:
1. Export audit log to JSON
2. Verify chain integrity
3. Create signed/notarized evidence package
4. Provide expert technical testimony if needed

## Example Use Cases

### Case 1: GDPR Consent Dispute

**Scenario**: Company claims user consented to data collection.

**Evidence**:
```bash
hsip-cli audit-query --destination "company.com" --limit 1000
```

**Shows**:
```
[Block] 2025-12-15 14:32:11 -> tracker.company.com (No consent)
[Block] 2025-12-15 14:35:22 -> analytics.company.com (No consent)
[Block] 2025-12-15 14:40:05 -> ads.company.com (Explicitly denied)
```

**Proves**: User never granted consent for tracking.

### Case 2: Phishing Attack

**Scenario**: Prove phishing attempt from specific IP.

**Evidence**:
```bash
hsip-cli audit-query --destination "malicious-site.com"
```

**Shows**:
```
[Block] 2026-01-10 03:15:42 -> malicious-site.com (Unknown source, high risk)
  IP: 203.0.113.42
  Geolocation: Eastern Europe
  Device fingerprint: Chrome/Linux, suspicious UA
```

**Proves**: Phishing attempt from specific location.

### Case 3: Message Authenticity

**Scenario**: Verify message was sent by specific user.

**Evidence**: Export consent requests showing Ed25519 signatures.

```json
{
  "grantee_vk_hex": "a3f5b2...",
  "sig_hex": "92c4d1...",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-13T10:30:45Z",
  "content_id": "msg_12345"
}
```

**Proves**: Message signed by private key holder (non-repudiation).
